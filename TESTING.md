## Browser Compatibility

* I tested the website on different browsers, including Google Chrome, Edge, and Mozilla. The site's functionalities are operating as intended, and the images are presented accurately.

* The layout and various features, such as buttons, the search bar, add to favorites/remove from favorites, comment form, inquiry form, add to cart, remove from cart, ordering process, and alerts, are all displayed correctly and functioning as expected. I created a new account and placed orders from all browsers without experiencing any errors.

## Testing Responsiveness

* Chrome DevTools was used for testing responsiveness on desktop, tablets, and smartphones.

* The page layout, images, search button, inquiry form, comment form, login, register/logout, ordering process, email verification process, favorite/unfavorite, modal message popup when user is not logged in and tries to add to favorites a product are all displayed correctly, as expected. 

* The testing on various devices has ensured that the site functions properly and provides the desired user experience.
