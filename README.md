### Design, colors and typography

The site's choice of black, white, and red is rooted in their significance in Romanian traditional clothing and culture, a palette that extends to the site's logo. 

The image on the landing page, with Romanian traditional motifs, offer a sense of familiarity to Romanian visitors and provides others with a chance to learn more about Romanian culture. This was inspired from the [blog - Ienationala](https://www.ienationala.ro/blog/index.php/2021/03/03/motive-traditionale-romanesti-care-sunt-principalele-simboluri-si-care-este-semnificatica-lor/)

* Color used for the navbar, landing page, footer, the body of the cards on the products page : #090601
* The text color scheme was black for the navbar menu and product description. White was used for the paragraphs that have as background color #8b181e and #090601.

* On the buttons I alternated and used the three colors 

* The color choices for the navigation bar, menu the different site sections and pages was selected to harmonize with the color of the static landing image on the homepage, ensuring a cohesive visual theme. 

Google fonts ‘'Amaranth’ and ‘Open Sans' were used. Specifically, ‘'Amaranth’ was employed for headings, navbar and buttons and ‘'Open Sans' was used for paragraphs. 
As per the [site-vandelaydesign] https://www.vandelaydesign.com/google-font-pairings/ these two fonts complement each other well. 

## Agile Methodology

* The development process, following an agile methodology, was managed using the GitHub Project.
* The link to the Project Kanban board can be accessed [here-Taste of romania User Stories](https://github.com/users/AdrianaStoi/projects/3). 
* Each user story was translated into a GitHub Issue, incorporating the EPIC, Acceptance Criteria, and Tasks. 
* To ensure clarity, every User Story includes well-defined acceptance criteria, further broken down into tasks for seamless execution. 
* Employing the MoSCoW prioritization technique, the User Stories were categorized from highest to lowest priority: "Must Have," "Should Have," "Could Have," and "Won't Have." 
* These stories were then assigned to corresponding milestones aligned with the project's sprint cycles.

## Wireframes and Database schema

### Wireframe

* I used Balsamiq Wireframes to create the wireframes for site layout. The wireframe can be found [here-Taste of Romania-balsamiq wireframes](): 
* The layout of the site has changed throughout the project development due to time constraints. As a result, some of the features originally outlined in the wireframe as the User Profile page are to be implemented in the future.

### Database schema

* In order to create and plan the databse structure, I used [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to create a Database ER diagram.

* The diagram is available [here-Taste of Romania-Lucidchart](https://github.com/AdrianaStoi/Taste-of-Romania/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/Lucidchart-Taste%20of%20Romania.pdf).

* I applied Object-Oriented Programming principles in the project, along with Django’s Class-based generic views. I created three additional custom models besides the ones from the walkthrough (Product, Order Line, Order, Category, User Profile). These new custom models are "Review", "Favorites" and "Inquiry". 
* I used Allauth library for the user authentication system.

* The **"Review"** model enables logged in users to comment on products. The Review comment model includes the fields "Comment" and "Rating". The "Product" custom model is linked as a Foreign Key ensuring that each comment is associated with a specific product.  Also, the ‘User’ built in model serves as a Foreign Key, as each comment is attributed to a single user.

* The "rating" field was not implemented in the project at this time due to time constraints. This feature is to be added at a later time.  

* The **"Favorite"** model includes a "product" field that serves as a foreign key, linking to the associated product. In addition, there is a "user" field, which acts as another foreign key, linking to the user who marked the product as a favorite. Finally, the model incorporates an "is_favorite" boolean field, which serves to indicate whether the associated product holds the status of a product marked as a favorite by the user.

* The **"Inquiry"** model is designed with fields to capture and manage user queries. It includes a user field, functioning as a Foreign Key and linking to the respective User involved in the inquiry. The profile field is also a Foreign Key, however this field was not used in the functions at this time.

* Contact details are recorded through the name CharField, email EmailField, and phone_number CharField. The subject CharField allows users to define the topic of their inquiry, while the message TextField accommodates detailed information. The order_number CharField is available for users to associate inquiries with specific orders. Admin responses are stored in the admin_reply TextField, facilitating communication between users and administrators. Additionally, the user_reply TextField offers the option for users to respond or provide further information. This comprehensive model ensures a structured approach to managing and responding to user inquiries effectively.
